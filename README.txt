# Files
#
Please note that files are saved to "%APPDATA%/../LocalLow/JackSimmons/Dissertation".
In this folder:
User preferences are in Preferences.json - if it doesn't exist, no preferences have
been set.
User-created plots are in the Plots/ folder.
plot.dat and plot.gnuplot are runtime-created files for plotting.
Other files are generated by Unity.

# Program Executable
#
To run the program, run the executable provided. (Builds/FinalBuild/Dissertation.exe)

#
# Program Layout
#
Some aspects of the program are only visible through the Unity Editor. For example,
fields marked "[SerializeField]" are given values through the Unity Editor, and some
Listener Methods are called by GameObjects (which are typically created in the Unity
Editor "Hierarchy" tab).

Viewing these features requires Unity, which can be installed through the Unity Hub.
This can be found at https://unity.com/download.
Through the Unity Hub, you'll need to install the Unity Editor (preferably version
2021.3.24f1, which was used during development).

Then load Unity Hub, and press "Add project from disk" (Unity Hub 3.7.0).
Then select the folder containing the .sln file for the project.

Now select the project by name under the main "Projects" menu.
It will take a while to load. The "Library" folder it generates here makes subsequent
loads faster.

Note: If Unity opens into a scene called "Untitled" or "New Scene", you will need to load
the scene manually. To do this go to "File" -> "Open Scene", then open the scene file
"Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity". The whole project is contained in this one scene.

Use the Hierarchy tab to navigate between all GameObjects that are generated immediately
when loading the program. After clicking on one, you can use the Inspector tab to view it
in more detail, to see attached Components and Scripts.
