To run, there are two different ways; a GUI (Unity) and a console.


Users of the software should use Unity for ease of use.
However the console version yields better performance and should be
used for experiments. (Worst-case improvement: Less RAM and CPU usage by
Unity frees up more for the algorithm itself).


Unity Version:
To view the program, just run the executable provided.


To see the UI design, install Unity (preferably version 2021.3.24f1).
Then load Unity Hub, and press "Add project from disk" (Unity Hub 3.7.0).
Then select the folder containing the .sln file for the project.

Note: Unity is a demanding process, and is very slow.

Now select the project by name under the main "Projects" menu.
It will take a while to load. The "Library" folder it generates here
makes subsequent loads faster.

This allows you to see and edit the UI design. 

Note: You may need to load the scene manually. To do this: "File" -> "Open Scene"
then navigate to "Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity".
Press the Play button at the top to run the program.
